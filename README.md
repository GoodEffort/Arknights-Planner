Data Compilation:
https://github.com/GoodEffort/Arknights-Planner-Data

How to use
 - On the bottom of the page you can add operators to your plan
 - From there you can click Plan up top on and input the current levels and the planned levels
 - Then input the items in your inventor under "Current Inventory"
 - The site will then calculate your missing items and you can even break those down to what you should farm
 - Import/Export your data on the top right

Troubleshooting:
If you run into an issue where the page stops working due to some invalid state try these steps. I haven't had to do this for a long time, but I have been making some quicker changes lately so I may have introduced some bugs

 - THIS WILL DELETE ALL YOUR SAVED DATA
 - Press F12 (or however your browser opens the developer console)
 - In the developer console type in: localstorage.clear()
 - press Enter and refresh the page

things I want to add
 - a way to sync your saved plans across devices (In progress)
 - crafting recommendation
 - share link to move it to another device/browser (new Import/Export feature kind of does this, I want it easier still)
